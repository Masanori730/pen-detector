# Pen Detector
Pen Detector is a compact computer-vision project that uses a camera and a YOLO-based AI model to detect pens in real time. Built for makers, students, and tinkerers, it demonstrates how modern deep-learning models can run on lightweight hardware to recognize everyday objects with surprising accuracy.
